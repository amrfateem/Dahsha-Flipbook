Then the Bio-Bottle of Tacx is a great choice. It stands out because the plastic of the bottle     is biodegradable. Adding a small amount of bio-material changes the molecular structure so the material ﬁnally breaks up in biogas and biomass. This feeds the soil     and it's completely absorbed by nature. The process of disintegration starts when the bottle ends up at a microbiological environment (compost heap, waste disposal).

Not only does it write like a pencil, but the markings can be erased. It works by leaving a graphite line on paper just like a regular traditional wooden pencil but it wears down so slowly, that it should outlast up to 100 traditional wooden pencils!

Then the Bio-Bottle of Tacx is a great choice. It stands out because the plastic of the bottle is biodegradable. Adding a small amount of bio-material changes the molecular structure so the material ﬁnally breaks up in biogas and biomass. This feeds the soil and it's completely absorbed by nature. The process of disintegration starts when the bottle ends up at a microbiological environment (compost heap, waste disposal).
